---

Here you can find an alphabetical list of research team members by university, along with their specialty within the CREATE. You can learn more about their research by following the link to their professional websites.

To apply to participate in the CREATE program, first ensure one of the supervisors below has agreed to take you on (full participation my be subject to funding availability). A summary of the program components may be found [here (.pdf)](qcs-create2024.github.io/assets/CREATE-QCS-info-packet.pdf). Once your supervisor has agreed to take you on, download and complete the [participation agreement/requirements form (.pdf)](qcs-create2024.github.io/assets/CREATE-QCS-requirements.pdf) and have your supervisor return it to the Program Coordinator.

title: Microcredentials
subtitle: Complement your QCS experience
---

Each graduate-level (masters and PhD) trainee must complete one microcredential. Trainees should discuss with their supervisor 
about what microcredential topics might be of interest to them and/or of value to their future carreer plans.

Microcredentials may be offered outside the CREATE program (for example, a project management microcredential 
offered by one of the participating universities, or by a government or industry partner as part of an internship). 
Trainees may also complete one of the microcredentials listed below. 

Once you have completed this requirement, download and complete the [confirmation form (.pdf)](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/microcredentials/CREATE-QCS-microcredential-completion-form.pdf) 
and email it to the Program Coordinator for our records.

Each graduate-level (masters and PhD) trainee must complete one microcredential. Trainees should discuss with their supervisor 
about what microcredential topics might be of interest to them and/or of value to their future carreer plans.

Microcredentials may be offered outside the CREATE program (for example, a project management microcrednential 
offered by one of the participating universities, or by a government or industry partner as part of an internship). 
Trainees may also complete one of the microcredentials listed below.

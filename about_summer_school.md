### About the annual summer school

This premier 5-day event will bring together CREATE trainees from the four
participating universities, and will be hosted at the University of Waterloo. Activities will include
presentations, workshops, and plenty of networking and relationship-building opportunities. The
summer school will also facilitate participation in other program components. PhD-level trainees
must attend **two** summer schools, and MSc-level trainees must attend **one** summer school.

### Success! QCS Summer School 2025
The inaugural 2025 CREATE QCS Summer School took place July 21-25 at the University of Waterloo. 
We had an exciting week of workshops, networking, and presentations from some of our co-PIs as
well as from invited speakers external to the CREATE. See the week's schedule below.

### Student poster session
Our dedicated QCS students prepared posters on their exciting QCS research and presented them at 
a poster session on July 25th. Check out the [poster archive](/assets/posters2025/posters2025.md), 
and the [complete collection of abstracts (.pdf)](/assets/posters2025/abstracts2025.pdf) from 
the 2025 Summer School.

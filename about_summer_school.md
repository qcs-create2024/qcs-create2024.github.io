### About the annual summer school

This premier 5-day event will bring together CREATE trainees from the four
participating universities, and will be hosted at the University of Waterloo. Activities will include
presentations, workshops, and plenty of networking and relationship-building opportunities. The
summer school will also facilitate participation in other program components. PhD-level trainees
must attend **two** summer schools, and MSc-level trainees must attend **one** summer school.

### Save the date!
The inaugural 2025 CREATE QCS Summer School is scheduled for July 21-25. We look forward to hosting you 
at the University of Waterloo!

We have planned an exciting week of workshops, networking, and presentations from some of our co-PIs as
well as from invited speakers external to the CREATE. See the tentative schedule below.

### Background
The NSERC CREATE grant “Training for novel directions in quantitative climate science” is 
an exciting opportunity for **undergraduate, masters, and doctoral students** to obtain funding to 
participate in an enhanced undergrad/grad school experience. The goal of this training program is 
to foster deep, long-term, cross-sector collaborations (i.e., academia, government and industry) in
climate science that are rooted in quantitative tools and to provide a pipeline of trainees for these
sectors to access.

Students studying within the broad scope of quantitative climate science (QCS) at the University
of Waterloo, University of Toronto, McGill University, and Dalhousie University are invited to apply.
Participants will pursue interdisciplinary research with internationally-recognized researchers from
these universities, in rapidly growing areas spanning _data-centric/high-performance computing in
QCS_, _artificial intelligence in QCS_, and _computational oceanography_. You can learn more about the 
research team and their areas of expertise [here](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/qcs_co_pis/).

### Program highlights
Highlights of program participation are:
* an [**annual summer school**](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/about_summer_school/) where you will meet and interact with other CREATE participants,
* specialized [**training modules**](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/modules/modules_main/) on topics not typically covered in grad school courses,
* [**professional development workshops**](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/professional_development/) to hone your writing and oral presentation skills, and other "soft skills,"
* opportunities for [**academic exchanges**](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/exchanges_internships/) with partner universities, and [**paid internships**](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/exchanges_internships/),
* opportunities to obtain **conference travel** funding to present your research,
* **networking** with other CREATE trainees and experts from the participating universities, as well as from government and industry,
* and more!

### The Fellows Committee
This committee will consist of CREATE trainees and will represent the
interests and developing needs of this group. Membership will be composed of up to 5 members with
an aim to represent all participating institutions. A maximum of 2 Fellows Committee members can
be based in any one participating department. The Fellows Committee will organize academic (e.g.,
reading groups) and professional (e.g., mock interviews, presentation workshops) activities, and will
be encouraged to interface with national student groups such as the CMOS Student Chapter. This
committee will meet up to twice per year.

### Peer mentorship
All trainees will be encouraged to seek out peer mentors from across the
participating universities to discuss and share their student experiences within and outside of the
CREATE program. The CREATE leadership team expects to facilitate this with an online tool
such as Slack. The Fellows Committee may consider developing a “buddy program” to help pair
new trainees with peer mentors, and to organize dedicated peer mentorship-related activities.

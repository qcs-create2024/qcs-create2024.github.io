### Success! QCS Summer School 2025
The inaugural 2025 CREATE QCS Summer School took place July 21-25 at the University of Waterloo. 
We had an exciting week of workshops, networking, and presentations from some of our co-PIs as
well as from invited speakers external to the CREATE. See the week's schedule below.

### Student poster session
Our dedicated QCS students prepared posters on their exciting QCS research and presented them at 
a poster session on July 25th. Check out the [poster archive](/assets/posters2025/posters2025.md), 
and the [complete collection of abstracts (.pdf)](/assets/posters2025/abstracts2025.pdf) from 
the 2025 Summer School.

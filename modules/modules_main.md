### About the training modules
Each graduate-level (masters and PhD) trainee will be expected to complete
**three** training modules. These will bridge subject matter expertise in climate, ocean, environmental,
and geographical science core areas with cutting-edge methods in computer science,
including AI and data science. 

PhD-level trainees will be required to help co-develop, modify, and
improve training modules for future cohorts, drawing on their research and internship/exchange
experiences to inform the improvements.

### Academic mentorship
Each CREATE trainee will have either an undergraduate advisor or a masters/
PhD supervisor, who will be one of the internationally-recognized [CREATE supervisors](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/qcs_co_pis/) 
from one of the four participating universities. Graduate-level trainees are encouraged to discuss with
their supervisor about including another CREATE supervisor(s) on their supervisory/defence committee
(note that this may depend on local institutional policies). This will broaden trainee perspectives
and provide multiple role models for work-life balance, funding pathways, and professional
goal setting.

### Communication skills workshops
Graduate-level trainees will be required to complete workshops on written
and oral scientific communication. These workshops will be hosted by professional writing/
communication experts, and will be scheduled during the [summer school](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/about_summer_school/).

### Microcredentials
Graduate-level trainees will be required to obtain one microcredential to
complement their QCS training. One example might be a project management microcredential
offered by one of the participating universities, or by a government or industry partner as part of an
internship. Trainees should discuss with their supervisor about what microcredential topics might
be of interest to them and/or of value to their future carreer plans.

Microcredentials offered by the CREATE program can be found [here](https://qcs-create2024.github.io/microcredentials/microcredentials_main/).

### Conference travel funding
All trainees will be welcome to apply for conference travel funding
to present their CREATE-funded research. Conferences are a great opportunity to apply the
communication skills learned at the summer school by presenting your research to fellow conference
participants, learn about the latest research in your area, and grow your academic and professional
network.

Conference travel funding for conferences scheduled through August 2026 is available in the form of a QCS Conference Travel Award! 
The conference travel funding procedure and application document can be found here:

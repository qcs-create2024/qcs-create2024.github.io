### Academic exchanges/visits
The CREATE program provides opportunities to travel to partner
institutions to participate in collaborative research, gaining teamwork and communication skills,
along with alternative research perspectives. Exchanges are **mandatory** for PhD-level trainees, and
**strongly reccommended** for masters-level trainees. 

The annual summer school will be a great place
to discuss exchange opportunities with supervisors from the participating universities. Exchanges
can consist of one or more experiences, but must have a combined duration of **two weeks**. Individual
exchange experiences should be discussed on a case-by-case basis with your supervisor and potential
exchange supervisor. 

Participating undergraduate students will be encouraged to explore graduate
opportunities at participating institutions.

### Paid Internships
Trainees are encouraged to get hands-on experience through 4-month paid
internships in government laboratories and climate technology companies. Through internships,
trainees will gain real-world work experience in professional settings. Internships will enlarge
trainees’ professional networks, expose them to data handling methods, and model types used
in government and industry, and provide training opportunities not possible in a typical graduate
studies’ setting. Internships will provide practical opportunities to develop skills in communication
(written and oral), teamwork and conflict resolution, project management, ethics, and knowledge
transfer.
